				<p class="info-p">
					Plodd Stop is situated in a semi-rural area on the outskirts of the city of
					Pattaya. A little over an hours drive from Bangkok International Airport,
					Plodd Stop is the ideal base from which to explore South East Thailand and
					its surrounding islands, or to simply stop over and give yourself and your
					vehicle a well-earned break from your long adventure.

						Whether you are travelling with your large overlander truck, motorhome,
						4×4 or motorcycle, Plodd Stop offers everything you need to make your
						stay comfortable, together with all the essential services required for a

					<p class="info-p">
						PLODD STOP Completed in early 2016, Plodd Stop is the inspiration of Dave
						& Lesley Goodchild.

						As experienced Overlanders themselves, they hope they have considered
						everything that may be required when undertaking your journey. They
						completed their own trips from England to Thailand in 2014 and from
						Thailand to England in 2017, a total of 65,000km in “Plodd” – a converted
						ex-police prison truck…hence the name “Plodd Stop”! Having been
						semi-permanent residents of Thailand for over twenty five years, they
						have travelled many times throughout the adjoining countries and can
						provide invaluable advice in respect of border crossings. Their other
						overland trips have taken them throughout South Africa, West and Eastern
						Europe and North America.

				<p class="info-p">
					Plodd Stop Overlander Base is run by David. It is located next to our
					house, just outside Pattaya city, with plenty of shops and places to eat
					nearby. Unfortunately, we cannot provide much by way of catering, although
					we do have a very nice roof top patio, with a fridge, water heater and a
					microwave oven. There is also a pool table and darts board for use only by
					adults. It’s an ideal place to enjoy a cold beer and meet other travelers
					to discuss experiences, exchange information etc. Plodd Stop is getting to
					be very well known among overlanders visiting Thailand. I have been able to
					collate a fair bit of knowledge about local suppliers and repairers too.
				</p>
				<p class="info-p">
					Plodd Stop can accommodate up to five large vehicles and several
					motorcycles in a completely secure yet tranquil setting. Planted with
					mature palm trees, the complex is gated and illuminated in the evenings.

				<p class="info-p">
					The complexes roof terrace with views of Pattaya in the distance, is the
					ideal place to relax and enjoy the sun throughout the day or as the
					temperature cools down, an early evening drink. An ideal opportunity to
					exchange your experiences with other like minded travelers from around the
					world, who as seasoned travelers will be able to share some of their own
					adventures with you.
				</p>
				<p class="info-p">
					Ideal for overland camping vehicles, motorcycles or indeed for overlanders
					wanting a break from sleeping within their own vehicles, Plodd Stop offers
					a selection of accommodation. On the first floor we have an en-suite
					air-conditioned twin bedded room with its own large private balcony. On the
					ground floor there is a self-contained air-conditioned apartment which has
					its own kitchen/lounge, separate double bedded room and bathroom.
				</p>
				<p class="info-p">
					Also on the ground floor there are two single bedded rooms with ceiling
					fans and shared showers/toilets.
				</p>
				<p class="info-p">
					The many facilities available include, separate gents & ladies toilets
					together with shower rooms in the public areas, Free Fibre WiFi, the use of
					our vehicle inspection pit, non-drinking water filling tap, self-service
					washing machine* and electric hook-up** (*washing machine charged at Bt 50
					**Electricity hook-up charged based on usage at Bt 20 per unit).
				</p>
				<p class="info-p">
					That’s not all…our “Overlanders Information Exchange” will show maps of
					Thailand & its adjoining countries, include a travelers message board,
					offer a book exchange, display a varied selection of tourist information
					and a comprehensive directory of local amenities including car/motorcycle
					hire, mechanics, doctors, dentists, supermarkets, hospitals and
					restaurants. Directly opposite Plodd Stop, a small authentic inexpensive
					restaurant has opened and offers exceptional Thai food.
				</p>
				<p class="info-p">
					We also offer long-term very secure vehicle storage should you need to
					return home before setting out on the next stage of your adventure.
					Pre-booking is essential as this facility has become extremely popular.
					Don’t forget to collect your “Plodd Stop Vehicle Sticker” on your
					departure…we need your help in spreading the word of what a fantastic
					facility we have to offer!
